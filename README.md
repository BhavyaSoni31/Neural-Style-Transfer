# Neural-Style-Transfer

This Repo shows one of the application of CNN and Transfer Learning, Neural Style Transfer using Pytorch. The images for content and style image are randomly picked from google.

We can change the optimizer to adam and try different learning rates,try different style and content weights to see different results.

app.py is web app version where you can see UI and upload images easily and get the output images. Also you can download images that are generated every 50 epochs. To run the app download the file and execute this in cmd: streamlit run app.py 

The app is deployed on :- https://share.streamlit.io/bhavyasoni31/neural-style-transfer/app.py  (Modifications are coming. This was just a trial.ðŸ™‚)
